FEATURES:
1. Here you can upload your file and a progress bar will be shown showing the upload progress.
2. A unique url will be generated for that file which you can share with your friend.
3. you can directly share it via email from that page.
4. that unique url will take the user to a download page where you can doenload the shared file.


For now, the backend is not connected. so inplace of the unique url a simple text is shown.Some features are not working because of no backend connection.
not able to connect the backend with database.
