Future plans::
1.Add support for **Spotify** via Spotify Api through tekore.py
2.Add voice support and speech feature to the bot for someone feeling to lonely or lazy to text!
3.Add **rank system** like MEE 6 bot.(will use databases for that)
4.**More** moderation commands(like create text and voice channels and the others mentioned above!)
5.Use AI libraries to extend the chat feature so that the bot can learn as it's trained.
6.Add database functionality to the add the above features and some more.
7.Manage the files with the in built os library.



Made by referring to::
1.**discord.py** Documentation Release 0.16.12.
2.**youtube_dl** library for handling the Music bot part.
3.**equation.py** for coverting the inputted string to an expression/ equation without using the unsecure eval() method!
4.Using the pyCharm IDE as it is better for handling python packages
5.Python version 3.9.0 documentation.
