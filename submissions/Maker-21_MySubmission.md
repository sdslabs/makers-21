I made a game using GODOT Game Engine, which is a sea world treasure hunt.
The name of the game is "A DOT.(A Desire Of Treasure.)". This game has various feature including a shop to upgrade your gear and weapons.
It also has a catalog to describe various enemies and different type of obstacle. The animation and drawing of characters are made by me and younger brother.

I have uploaded a trailer video of this game on Youtube here's the link for same: https://youtu.be/V-GcpFdjpcg
