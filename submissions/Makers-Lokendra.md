A glance of my submission::

To-do list keep the record of thing that has to be done in the coming future. we can remove the things one by one when completed.
My list also keep a record of deadLine and approx. time require to complete the work. And it also keep show the short description of the work that has to be done.

Improvements I would like to make::
1) I didnt add a database to the react app.Thus having a perfect backend is the most important and neccessary improvement.
2) My app will arrange the work according to the deadline.
3) While using a database , i will add a login system. Thus different user can use this app accordingly
4) This app must provide notification of the work to be done when the deadline is quite close and work had not been done.
