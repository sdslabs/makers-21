Is this the project from one of the ideas listed on ideas documents: Yes.

_Site-Blocker_ is a chrome-extension designed to enhance your productivity and limit your time spent on addictive sites.
It allows a user to provide a list of sites to be blocked, which won't open unless the block is removed. Moreover, a timer is provided in case the site needs to be closed at the input time(not yet implemented fully).
