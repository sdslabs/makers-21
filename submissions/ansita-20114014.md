Additional Description:

I've made a Google Chrome Extension that helps you limit your time on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

Since I was at a loss of time (I started learning html/css/js two days after the ETE) I haven't yet made all the features completely and some parts are out of order :') But still it works like a timer for now, and I'll try to get over with this ASAP!

Up until now, it looks somewhat like this: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76224935/111879801-f06e6600-89cd-11eb-9065-7f470885d6eb.png
