Is this project one of the ideas listed on ideas document? No

I started creating a p2p file-sharing app named filepass where one could upload files by dragging or browsing and 
create a link for it which could be sent to anyone.

The project has a complete frontend. But I faced issues during back-end , did it as much as i could so it's incomplete. 
Still willing to work on it.


## Features
It starts uploading automatically as you upload the file and provides you a link which you can copy directly.
It (was intended to) generate a unique name for the file using the uuid4 function so that you get a unique url and thus prevent using of your files by anyone else.
It is user friendly as it provides drag and drop option.
It uses mongodb database
